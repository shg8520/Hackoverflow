Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a noticeable decline in the overall health of an
individual be it physically or mentally. As many jobs are turned out to be remote, attending
classes online, etc., adds more to the health consequences. Our idea is to create a system
that collects information on their physical activities throughout the day, their working
conditions, and how they usually maintain their mental health. Thus the required plan of
action, tips, and suggestions for the betterment are provided in the form of physical
exercises, yoga poses, meditation, and relaxation techniques by doing a deep analysis of
the data provided. The data will be collected and stored from the user input. Then they are
classified into different categories. Based on the categorized data, each will have respective
suggestions and tips provided through the analysis made. This model is integrated into a
web application built using technologies like the python-Django stack.
